**DESCRIPTION**

This is html advanced.This is quite different from the basic html.
I am trying to clone a gadget store for this project.
I believe i am learning faster.
it is pure html and not styled with CSS yet.
So the page might not be shiny yet because it is not styled yet.

**WHAT I LEARNT**

- I learnt the right html semantics
- I learnt how to add images to my html file
- I learnt how to clone websites even if it's not styled yet

All thanks to @alx_africa for giving us these projects to improve our coding skills.
